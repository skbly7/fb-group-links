Facebook Group Links
====================

This repo contains code which consumes FaceBook Graph APIs, for fetching various links shared in private groups, and convert that data into as useful view as possible, to save time of group members.
It also, provides a way to make your group "Public" (as much required), without adding external member into group.

Currently this code can be used in following two ways:

- **Link searcher**<br>
Many of times, we are added in such groups, where hundreds of links are shared every month. This lead to time taking process, if you wish to find an old remember you link was shared in group. Also, many different scenerios revolving like this.<br>It's the time when you can directly deploy this tool, and make your group free from such problems. Code can be found in [this branch](https://github.com/skbly7/fb-group-links/tree/link_directory) for above purpose.<br>[Demo](http://www.okrdx.com/files/osdc/)

- **Music community**<br>
Love music ? Love to share what you like ?<br>Yes! There are many groups in which music is shared by group members round the clock. All of those songs are precious, but due to FaceBook, only recent ones are available. It is damn easy to share music in such group, but finding or listing is a time taking process, in which most of time you end up clicking **Play** button hundred of times. This is the current problem we are trying to solve, by giving music community completly different shape than FaceBook.<br>[Demo](http://www.okrdx.com/files/music/)
